## üß† What Is QUAOBF?

QUAOBF is a **proof-of-concept tool** that wraps a Windows `.exe` file in multiple defensive layers:
- **AES-256-CBC encryption** with random key & IV
- **Custom XOR obfuscation** with bit rotation and masking
- **File padding** to arbitrary size (e.g., 100 MB) to hinder static analysis
- **Runtime anti-VM / anti-sandbox checks** (processes, drivers, MAC, CPU, IP, timing)
- **Self-decrypting loader** compiled into a single-file EXE via PyInstaller

If a suspicious environment is detected, the payload **is never executed**‚Äîonly a harmless GUI counter appears before exit.

This project is **strictly for educational use** to help developers and researchers understand:
- Binary protection fundamentals
- Evasion detection logic
- Secure loader design

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimers

- **Antivirus Alerts Are Expected**: Packed, self-decrypting binaries with anti-analysis logic will trigger heuristic detections. This is normal and **not a bug**.
- **Not for Malware**: Using QUAOBF to hide malicious payloads violates GitHub‚Äôs policies and may be illegal.
- **No Warranty**: Use at your own risk. The authors assume no liability for misuse or damage.
